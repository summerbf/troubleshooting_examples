#code_understanding

I have commented on the scripts directly for these ones. I do a portion of CBIG_preproc_fMRI_preprocess.csh (up to 229/ end of 1st Preprocess step)

This code was already commented, but my additional comments are have "##" to clarify. If I had given an example of understanding an idea before, I didn't comment again unless it was important to another step. I also left some of Yeo's own comments because he already described what was happening effectively. 

In all honesty, some of the nitty gritty of this I am still learning, especially since the last month has been my first experience with cshell, but I feel like I understand what this script is doing and if need be I could look up the nitty gritty items to go into more detail.
