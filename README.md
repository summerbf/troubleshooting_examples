# troubleshooting_examples

I've split the troubleshooting examples into three parts. 
  1. Easy examples are pretty basic things that were going wrong that weren't too difficult to solve
  2. example_1 is an example of one that I solved completely by myself
  3. example 2 is an example of one that I solved a majority but had a key insight from my advisor

#Logs contain the error messages and .csh files are the scripts. 
#I have only included the most relevant scripts (and logs), but if you would like to see all scripts, you can find the whole CBIG repository here: https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG
